### Fantasy processor(s)

This repository is meant to be a collection of emulated components. I'm only looking to emulate the interface, not the actual electrical workings.

The only one as of now is the V16alpha, a 16-bits processor. Files :

 - v16alpha.md contains the manual
 - v16alpha.py contains the actual processor as a class
 - v16alpha_asm.py contains the assembler
 - v16alpha_test.py can be executed to test the processor
